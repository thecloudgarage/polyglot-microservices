This is a cute demo that I use to exhibit polyglot microservices running on k8s. Have tested this on Tanzu Kubernetes Grid-Integrated (erstwhile Enterprise PKS) and salso KOPS-AWS. The application use-case is although a simple ToDo list, however, it is built using Javascript, NodeJS, SpringBoot, Python, Go, Redis as a state-store (cluster with statefulsets and persistent volumes) and Zipkin for OpenTracing. WIP: Deploying the same on CloudFoundry<>TanzuApplicationService<>PivotalApplicationService :)
